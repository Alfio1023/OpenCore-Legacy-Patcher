I had a problem with my imac 2012 - 13.2, where I successfully installed macos 13.01.

But with OpenCore-patcher 0.51 and even 0.50 it does not install on Post-Install Menu - Graphics: Nvidia Kepler and - Graphics: Intel Ivy Bridge, I restart it but never install them.

Would you have any advice? Thank you in advance.
